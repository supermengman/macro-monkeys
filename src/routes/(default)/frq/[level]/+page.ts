			Write a static method getColumn, which returns a one-dimensional array containing the elements of a single column in a two-dimensional array. The elements in the returned array should be in the same order as they appear in the given column. The notation arr2D [r] [c] represents the array element at row r and column c. 
			The following code segment initializes an array and calls the getColumn method. 
			int[][] arr2D = { { 0, 1, 2 } , { 3, 4, 5 } , { 6, 7, 8 } , { 9, 5, 3 } }; 
			int[] result = ArrayTester.getColumn (arr2D, 1)
			When the code segment has completed execution, the variable result will have the following contents: {1, 4, 7, 5} 
			
			public static int[] getColumn (int[] arr2D, int c) {
